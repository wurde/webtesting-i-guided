# Hubs Web API

Guided project for **Web Testing I** module.

In this module we will cover the basics of automated testing and use `jest` to write unit tests.

## Project Setup

- [x] fork and clone this repository.
- [x] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your fork**.

Please follow along as the instructor uses _Test Driven Development (TDD)_ to implement the `add()` feature of a simple `calculator`.
